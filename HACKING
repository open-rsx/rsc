Coding Style
------------

* Indentation: Spaces only, 4 spaces

* Braces:
** Always use braces, also for single-line blocks
** Opening brace on same line as e.g. if statement

if (foo) {
    doThis();
}

* Name conventions:
** Camel-Case for everything except constants
** functions, methods and members with smallFirstLetter
** Class names with CapitalLetter
** THIS_IS_A_CONST

* New-lines:
** One new-line to separate methods and functions etc.
** Each namespace declaration in a single line
** New-line at end of file

* Includes:
** Include order:
**# Own file header (cpp file)
**# stdlib and c-lib headers
**# external library headers
**# internal header
** Each separated with one new-line (also for different external libraries)
** Relative includes for own headers

* Documentation:
** Doxygen with javadoc-like auto-brief option (first sentence is brief description) 
** Documentation in header files
