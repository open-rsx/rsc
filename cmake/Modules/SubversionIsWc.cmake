# - Checks whether a folder is a subversion wokring copy
# The existing subversion wrappers in cmake do not provide a way to check
# whether a folder really is a working copy of subversion. This module adds
# a function to check this.
#
# Subversion_IS_WC(FOLDER RESULT_VAR)
#   Checks if FOLDER is a SVN working copy and sets the RESULT_VAR to a bool
#   value.
